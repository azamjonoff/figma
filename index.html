            This UI kit is designed to work with the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1325097335621267194">Figma to Shopify with Instant Plugin.</a> With this plugin you can send your Figma designs to Shopify in no-time. To get a better understanding how this works, please watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_tr3x3_Y6w&ab_channel=InstantPageBuilder">Figma to Shopify Tutorial.</a>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Our recommended workflow is to get familiar with the structure of the sections used in the kit. Change the components to your own branding and content, then publish to Shopify via Instant. Any updates you make here inside Figma require a new copy + paste action.
